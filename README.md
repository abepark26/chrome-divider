## About
Chrome Divider is a chrome extension that allows display of multiple pages in one window in order to enhance user's work efficiency when browsing, searching, and watching content when using Google Chrome.

## Commands

### SYSTEM DEFAULT
+ **switch window** [Cmd + `] - swtich focus between opened Chome windows
+ **switch tab** [Cmd + 1 (2, 3 ..., 8, 9)] - swtich focus between tabs in the same Chrome window

### SLICING
+ **slice window**  [Alt + Shit + Up] - slice the merged page into two (i.e. number of displayed pages is doubled)
+ **merge window**  [Alt + Shit + Down] - merge the sliced pages into one (i.e. number of displayed pages is halved)

### ROTATION
+ **rotate right**  [Alt + Shit + Right] - shift the opened windows to the right
+ **rotate left**  [Alt + Shit + Left] - shift the opened windows to the left

## Future Improvements / Roadmap
1. Need to test a lot more edge cases and fix bugs including failure to consider Mac Dock when calculating the display size.

2. More features including merging and rotating pages across different displays and adapting to various OS environments.

## Miscellaneous
1. Star, watch, and fork if you are interested :)
